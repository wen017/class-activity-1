5. Create a new data frame that only includes the variables `hash`, `lesson_name` and `attempt` called `DF2`
DF2 <- select(DF1, hash, lesson_name, attempt)


6. Use the `group_by` function to create a data frame that sums all the attempts for each `hash` by each `lesson_name` called `DF3`
DF3 <- DF2 %>% group_by(hash, lesson_name) %>% summarise(attempt = sum(attempt))

7. On a scrap piece of paper draw what you think `DF3` would look like if all the lesson names were column names

8. Convert `DF3` to this format  
DF3b <- spread(DF3, lesson_name, attempt)


9. Create a new data frame from `DF1` called `DF4` that only includes the variables `hash` and `correct`
DF4 <- DF1 %>% select(hash, lesson_name, correct)

10. Convert the `correct` variable so that `TRUE` is coded as the **number** `1` and `FALSE` is coded as `0`  
DF4$correct <- ifelse(DF4$correct == TRUE, 1, ifelse(DF4$correct == NA, NA, 0))

11. Create a new data frame that called `DF4` that provides a mean score for each student
DF5 <- DF4 %>% group_by(hash, lesson_name) %>% summarise(mean.score = mean(correct, na.rm = TRUE))

12. **Extra credit** Convert the `datetime` variable into month-day-year format and create a new data frame (`DF5`) that shows the average correct for each day

DF6 <- select(DF1, correct, datetime)
DF6$correct <- ifelse(DF6$correct == TRUE, 1, ifelse(DF6$correct == NA, NA, 0))
DF6$datetime <- as.POSIXlt(DF6$datetime, origin = "1970-01-01 00:00.00 UTC")
DF6$datetime <- strftime(DF6$datetime, format="%b:%e")
DF7 <- DF6 %>% group_by(datetime) %>% summarise(av.correct = mean(correct, na.rm = TRUE))
